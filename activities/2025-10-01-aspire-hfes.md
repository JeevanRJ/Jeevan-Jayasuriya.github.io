Recently presented my work as part of a larger defense-funded project aimed at developing biomarkers for fatigue at HFES 2025 in Chicago. The talk focused on the impacts of different sources of fatigue (mental, physical, and extended wakefulness) on risk-taking behavior, and how risk context shapes these effects.
