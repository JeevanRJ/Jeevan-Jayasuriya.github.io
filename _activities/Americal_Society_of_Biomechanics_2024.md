 I recently presented findings from a pilot study conducted to support the setup of our newly funded NASA project investigating the interactive effects of altered gravity and fatigue. The study involved 13 participants and helped identify potential challenges and necessary refinements to the experimental setup prior to the launch of the full-scale experiment, anticipated to begin in Fall 2024.
